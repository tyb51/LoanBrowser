# Next Steps for Loan-Insurance Refactoring

We've made significant progress on the loan-insurance refactoring project, completing all of Phase 1 (Data Model & Backend API Changes) and most of Phase 2 (Frontend Implementation). Here's what needs to be done in the next conversation:

## Phase 2: Complete Frontend Implementation

- Update the standalone pages (/, /comparison, /investment) to remove direct insurance inputs and direct users to cases for insurance-related functionality
- Review existing components to ensure they correctly handle and display the combined loan+insurance data

## Phase 3: Refinement & Testing

- Refactor the insurance calculation logic to ensure it works well with the new data model
- Perform comprehensive testing of all the new functionality
- Test CRUD operations for insurance simulations
- Test comparison and investment pages with various combinations of insurance simulations
- Verify database integrity and API endpoints

## Implementation Strategy for Next Conversation:

1. Start by examining the standalone calculator pages:
   - Main calculator page (app/page.tsx)
   - Comparison page (app/comparison/page.tsx)
   - Investment page (app/investment/page.tsx)

2. For each page:
   - Remove any direct insurance input fields
   - Update API calls to use the simplified parameters (without insurance)
   - Add a note/banner to guide users to use Cases for insurance-related functionality

3. Review the chart and table components in the components directory:
   - Ensure they correctly display combined loan+insurance data
   - Check for any hardcoded assumptions that may need to be updated

4. Review the insurance calculation logic in lib/insurance:
   - Ensure the functions are robust and can work with the new parameter storage
   - Confirm they can be used effectively by the backend API

5. Perform testing:
   - Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting insurance simulations
   - Test the comparison and investment pages with different insurance combinations
   - Verify everything works as expected

## Notes for Implementation:

- Use the existing code as a reference for styling and UI patterns
- Maintain consistency with the rest of the application
- Focus on user experience - make it clear how to use the new insurance simulation features
- Add appropriate error handling for edge cases

When all tasks are complete, the application will have a clean separation between loan and insurance simulations, allowing users to mix and match them for analysis while maintaining clear data organization.
